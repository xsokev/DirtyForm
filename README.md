========================================================================

DirtyForm - a mootools class for registering form elements and their values. It provides a function to determine if values have been changed.


Compatibility
----

DirtyForm has been tested with Mootools 1.3.x+


Overview
------------

DirtyForm was created out of a necessity to check if certain fields in a form were modified. It provides the ability to capture the current state of a form. It also provides a list of modified fields and their old and new values.


How to use
----------

Using DirtyForm is very simple.

	To initialize a form and its current values, instantiate a class as follows:
	var dirtyForm = new DirtyForm(frm, {
		excludes: [], 				// form fields that you do not want to check
		blockSubmitOnDirty: true,	// prevent form from submitting if it is dirty. Defaults to true.
		filterButtons: true			// not include buttons (<input type="submit" />, <input type="reset" />, <input type="button" />). Defaults to true.
	);
	
	
	If the form values change and you would like to capture the current state of the form, use the update() method.
	dirtyForm.update();
	
	Update will store the form current values using the field id as the identifier. If no field id exists, a unique id will be generated and assigned to the field.
	
	To check if any of the form's values has been modified, use the isDirty() method.
	dirtyForm.isDirty();
	
	After isDirty has been executed, the property "dirtyFields" of the class instance will contain a list of object for the fields whose values have changed since the last update. 
	dirtyForm.dirtyFields
	
	Each object contains:
		field		//the DOM representation of the field
		oldValue	//the last saved value of the field
		newValue	//the current value of the field
